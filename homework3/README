The Movie Analyzer Program

First, load the venv labeled imdb with the following in the terminal-
imdb\Scripts\activate

anaylze_data.py is going to be the work horse of this program, it has the functions to execute queries tasked in the assignment.
The following is the packages that need to be installed as the code depends on it to function
import sys
import json
import logging
from datetime import datetime                     
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Union   

The following is configuring the log function for debugging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(levelname)s:%(message)s')


analyze_data.py is a python program reads a JSON file of movie data and computes the following functions:
1. The most profitable movie of the last 5 years
2. Average budget of recent movies
3. Most common word in movie titles
4. Most profitable genre (optional)

data.json is required to run this program, as the program is coded to work with the JSON's formatting

The following function opens and reads the data.json file, the docstring attatched to the function givs a small 
description of the function, as well as the arguments and the returns

def read_json(filepath: str) -> Optional[List[Dict]]: 
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            logging.debug(f"Successfully loaded {len(data)} records from {filepath}.")
            return data
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
        logging.debug(f"Failed to load JSON file: {e}")
        return None

The test_analyze_data.py file runs unit tests using pytest. It is designed to run tests on the 3 functions in 


The following commands in terminal will be used to run the files using docker commands
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app kole21/movie_analyzer to run analyzer
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app kole21/movie_analyzer pytest test_analyze_data.py to run test
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app movie-analyzer pytest -s test_analyze_data.py this is optional for debug purposes
