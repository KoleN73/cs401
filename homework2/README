First, you need to build the images
Using the dockerfile_writer, and dockerfile_computer files, build the images using the docker build command as seen in the following:
docker build -t kole21/writer:1.0 -f dockerfile-writer .
docker build -t kole21/computer:1.0 -f dockerfile-computer .
(-t flag names the images, and -f tells Docker which Dockerfile to use)
(Keep in mind that it is case-sensitive when using dockerfile components)

Next, we can run each container separately using the following:
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/my-first-git-repo/homework2/ kole21/writer:1.0 writer.py /data/data.txt
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/my-first-git-repo/homework2/ kole21/computer:1.0 computer.py /data/data.txt /data/output.txt
(--rm removes the container after it exits, -v mount’s the host’s data folder into the container)
(${PWD} is used for windows machines)

This next section will run both files using docker compose
Run docker-compose build
Then follow up with: 
docker-compose up
This will build both images, run writer first, then run computer as it depends on writer

docker-compose down will stop everything up
